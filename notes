Survival in ship, console / UI is only interface, must repair broken systems.
Walk around to repair various panels.
Randomly generated ship layout?

What systems are needed? Toilet, bed, medical cabinet, thrusters, warp drive,
 reactor, battery, fuel / fluid storage, airlock, computer, sensors, weapons?,
 cargo area, grappling hook / docking system, piping and wiring of course,
 filters, pumps, atmospheric sensors, lights, toolbox, locker

How about a starbase instead? Starting with just a small number of components,
and events come to you.
- Could still implement travel, just through warp drive only. You have station-
  keeping thrusters to maintain, but no main engines.
- If you lose thrusters, your orbit starts slowly decaying (you can still just
  warp to a higher orbit of course)
- Start to fall into atmosphere? Can scoop from upper atmospheres, but starts to
  decay faster.
- Send out mining drones.
- 3D Printing tech? For manufacture? fluid plastic

Each tile needs to reference a Fluid (atmosphere). Volumes of atmosphere Fluids
are equal to 10 per tile. Volumes of single tanks are 8 per.
Doubles: 4   Triples: 3

Start:
- basic life support: bed, toilet, kitchen, atmospheric sensor, filter, pump,
  tankage (o2, co2, n2)
  (maybe I should use the scuba tanks icon for multiple tanks in one spot?)
- one thruster, uses n2
- battery, solar panels? (start in orbit close enough to a star?)
- warp drive, barely capable of warping your station
- docking arm / airlock (airlock at end of pylon)
- computer, basic sensors?, filters/pumps?, lights?
- locker w toolbox (locker is our cargo space to start)
